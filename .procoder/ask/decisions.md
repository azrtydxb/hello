# Decisions

## First build scope

- Phase 0 only (foundation), then a separate Phase 1 spec
- Phase 0 + Phase 1 in one milestone

## UI package manager

- npm
- pnpm

## Migration library

- goose
- golang-migrate

## Phase 0 delivery

- Commit on branch phase-0-foundation and open a PR to main
- Commit on the branch only, no PR yet
- Hold — leave uncommitted for review

## Merge PR #1

- Squash-merge now and start the Phase 1 spec
- Hold for your own review

## Phase 1 call model

- B2BUA (signaling only, SDP passed through, media direct)
- Stateful record-routing proxy

## Phase 1 registration store

- Valkey from Phase 1 (cluster-wide, HA-ready)
- In-memory per node until Phase 3

## Phase 1 management API auth

- Local users with sessions and API tokens, no roles yet
- Single bootstrap admin token from env

## Phase 1 automated SIP testing

- Go test user agents built on sipgo, run in CI
- SIPp scenarios in a container

## Phase 1 cross-node delivery to NAT'd phones

- Route via the registering node (Path + flow token, RFC 3327/5626 style)
- Test only without NAT (test phones inside the compose network); defer to Phase 3

## Phase 1 delivery

- Push phase-1-minimum-pbx and open a PR to main
- Hold for your review first
