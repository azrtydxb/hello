Answer each one by writing a line beginning `Answer: ` under it, then
hand the file back with `procoder ask --file .procoder/ask/QA.md`.
Leave the `Key:` lines alone — they are what ties an answer to its question.

## Q1: [decision] decisions.md

Key: add7750575a3
Question: In-call HA crash detection time

- Faster detection: membership heartbeat 1 s / TTL 4 s, so a crashed node's calls re-home in about 5 s; update docs to the measured numbers
- Keep 15 s detection; correct docs to the honest numbers (crash ~15–18 s gap, restart ~4 s, graceful <1 s)

Answer: Faster detection: membership heartbeat 1 s / TTL 4 s (re-home in ~5 s); docs updated to measured numbers
