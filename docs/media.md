# Media anchoring

Hello relays RTP through itself only when a feature needs it — NAT handling,
call recording, announcements, voicemail. Every other call is direct
endpoint-to-endpoint audio (spec §4, §16). This page describes when a call
anchors and what that means; the implementation detail lives in
`internal/media`.

## When a call anchors

| Trigger                   | Example                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| An endpoint is behind NAT | contact address differs from the packet source        |
| Recording is active       | `*1` pressed, or the extension's record default is on |
| An announcement plays     | ring-group failure destination, pre-transfer prompt   |
| Voicemail is involved     | unanswered/busy/DND call with a voicemail box         |
| The operator forces it    | `HELLO_MEDIA_FORCE_ANCHOR=true`                       |

An anchored call keeps its anchor until it ends — a mid-call re-INVITE can
add the anchor, but Hello does not remove it mid-call.

## Codecs

PCMU, PCMA, G.722 and Opus pass through the anchor untouched — Hello never
transcodes. Recordings store the pass-through payload as received (G.711
payloads are recorded as WAV; other codecs are stored with the codec noted
in the recording metadata).

## Metrics

`hello_rtp_sessions`, `hello_rtp_packets_total{direction}`,
`hello_rtp_octets_total{direction}`, `hello_rtp_loss_total{direction}`,
`hello_rtp_jitter_ms{direction}`, `hello_media_anchored_calls`,
`hello_media_anchor_failures_total`, `hello_recording_storage_bytes`.

## RTP port range

Anchor sessions draw RTP ports from `HELLO_RTP_PORT_MIN`–
`HELLO_RTP_PORT_MAX` (default 20000–21000) on the hello-sip node that owns
the call. When the range is exhausted, the call falls back to direct media
with a routing-trace step and a failure metric.

## Anchored media on kw (Kubernetes)

The anchor binds its relay legs on UDP `HELLO_RTP_PORT_MIN`–
`HELLO_RTP_PORT_MAX` (20000–21000). On kw the hello-sip pods run with
`hostNetwork: true`, so the legs bind the node IP, and
`HELLO_MEDIA_ANCHOR_HOST` (the Downward API's `status.hostIP`) is stamped
into every anchored SDP answer: a LAN phone sends its RTP straight to the
node at the advertised port pair. Both deployments carry a required
anti-affinity (one hello-sip per node: the pods bind node UDP 5060 and TCP
8082). The hello-sip Services stay ClusterIP with no RTP ports — no
Service can map a port range — and serve only the in-cluster paths:
Kamailio's dispatcher set 1 and the dialog routes
(`HELLO_SIP_ADVERTISED_ADDR` stays the Service name).

`HELLO_MEDIA_ANCHOR_HOST` is optional: unset, the SDP answers mirror the
offer's own c= address, which carries audio only when the peer can reach
the pod directly (the compose lab). Set it to the node's LAN IPv4 — on kw
the manifest derives it per node, so it stays correct wherever the pod
schedules. Before this wiring existed, a LAN phone's anchored calls
completed and recorded their signaling (CDR, traces, recording rows), but
RTP never reached the anchor, so recordings captured silence and
announcements/voicemail audio did not reach a LAN phone.

Anchoring triggers are unchanged: NAT detection, `*1` or per-extension
`record_default`, an announcement destination or pre-transfer prompt,
voicemail, or `HELLO_MEDIA_FORCE_ANCHOR=true`. On kw the force switch stays
off; see deploy/kuvryn-sync/kw/resources.yaml for the live env.
